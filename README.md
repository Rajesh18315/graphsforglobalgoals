Graph Analytics plays key role in understanding the data value generated through Sustainable Development Goals
Sustainable Development Goals, mostly known as SDG’s, are these 17 Goals that were setup by United Nations General Assembly and target to achieve these goals by 2030. 193 governments are actively involved in this and are several programs were launched by local governments to achieve this vision.

Here, we want to highlight, how these 17 SDG’s are interlinked with each other. The data that’s generated through different SSDG’s programs are more correlated.

Let me give you a quick example, how complex correlated data is, when we prefer to visualize with global data. Let’s see how SDG6 – Clean Water and Sanitation, and SDG-3 – Good Health and Well Being are correlated.
Here, we can see SDG 6—which focus on “Safe Drinking Water” and SDG3 – which focus on Health.
First map , we can see Life expectancy across globe at different countries in 2019. This bar Chart shows Top 10 countries with Most HIV Deaths.
 Here, You can see Bottom 10 countries with less life expectancy.
We can see one of the root cause here,

This map shows top 25 countries with more than 25% of their population who has no access to safe drinking water.
We can see how Water & Health are correlated here, 50% of countries in Bottom 10 of Life Expectancy and Top 10 countries with HIV deaths are part of top 25 countries with no access to safe drinking water.
This is how SDG’s data is very much correlated and definitely better visualization and Data Analytic tools can help to address root causes.
To address and highlight the importance of correlation between SDG’s, we had come up with this idea of “Graphs For Global Goals”.

Below is Schema , we developed , where We can see here User volunteers through an organization, and conducts an event at certain location.
Organizations that contribute to multiple SDG’s focusing on multiple key areas, all correlated data has to be recorded for analysis.
